Trail: Learning the Java Language
Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
Q1. What Is an Object?
    Real-world objects share two characteristics: They all have state and behavior.
    These real-world observations all translate into the world of object-oriented programming.
    Software objects are conceptually similar to real-world objects: they too consist of state and related behavior.
    An object stores its state in fields (variables in some programming languages)
        and exposes its behavior through methods (functions in some programming languages)
Q2. What Is a Class?
     In object-oriented terms, we say that your bicycle is an instance of the class of objects known as bicycles.
     A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created.
Q3. What Is Inheritance?
    Object-oriented programming allows classes to inherit commonly used state and behavior from other classes.
     In the Java programming language, each class is allowed to have one direct superclass,
        and each superclass has the potential for an unlimited number of subclasses:
Q4. What Is an Interface?
    an interface is a group of related methods with empty bodies
Q5. What Is a Package?
    A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces.
